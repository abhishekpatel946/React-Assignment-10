# React-Assignment-10
Using all the concepts of hooks you have gathered till now let's create a react app to achieve the following: 
```
* a simple reminder app  
* you can create reminders  
* a reminder would consist of a title  
* Time and date at which to remind   
* these reminders can be added updated and delete  also, 
* separate list showing all the upcoming reminders and the past reminders  
* Since this is a frontend task  
* please take user experience into consideration 
```

## Pending
```
1. Implement the whole thing with Redux-toolkit & Redux-saga & Redux-logger.
```

## DataFlow
```
1. Data fetch through the API and store the data using dispatching.
2. Every time get updated data from API, store in the redux-store.
3. Use the redux state to display the data whenever we use.
4. Redux-logger to watch each & every moment inside the redux.
5. Redux-saga to flow the data btw the redux-state and recieved from API call.
